## üìÑ **Task 4: Implement IAM Policies, Secure Storage, and Data Encryption on a Cloud Platform**

### üîê **Objective:**

To implement cloud security best practices by configuring Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, creating a secure storage bucket on AWS S3, and enabling server-side encryption to protect data.

---

### üìå **Key Activities Performed:**

1. **IAM Policy Creation**

   * Created a custom IAM policy (`CodtechS3AccessPolicy`) that grants limited access (list, upload, and download) to a specific S3 bucket.

2. **IAM User Setup**

   * Created an IAM user (`prachi-gupta`) and attached the custom policy to control their permissions securely.

3. **S3 Bucket Configuration**

   * Created an S3 bucket (`prachi-secure-bucket-2025`) to store files securely.
   * Uploaded a sample file to test functionality.

4. **Data Encryption**

   * Enabled **Server-Side Encryption with S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)** for automatic encryption of all objects uploaded to the bucket.

---

### üéØ **Outcome:**

A fully configured, secure cloud storage solution that uses IAM roles and encryption to ensure that data access is restricted and data at rest is protected. This setup meets the deliverable requirements of Task 4 in the CodTech Cloud Computing Internship.
